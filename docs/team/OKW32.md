## Overview
Wellness360 is a wellness app meant for stressed Engineering Students who prefer CLI over GUI 
and want to keep track of their overall wellbeing. Our app offers comprehensive tracking and management
tools, providing personalized support to alleviate stress and enhance overall well-being with features
including a Fitness Tracker, Focus Timer, Habit Tracker, Self Reflection and Sleep Tracker.

### Summary of Contributions
The common class Ui allows for printing on a command-line interface (CLI), which streamlines output formatting and 
interaction. It typically provides methods to display text and format output. This abstraction simplifies
UI development by encapsulating common tasks like displaying programme's output.

The Sleep Tracker feature of Wellness360 has various functionalities ranging from adding/deleting sleep 
cycles, updating/getting sleep cycle information, listing sleep cycles, to saving sleep cycles in a text
file for permanent storage of sleep cycles added in Wellness360.

A quick User Guide and Developer Guide was done up on the Sleep Tracker functions, to showcase the various
functionalities of the Sleep Tracker in Wellness360, with a class diagram to help illustrate the structure of Sleep Tracker by
showing the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. A sequence diagram was also used to depict how objects 
interact after user keys in an input to be executed by Sleep Tracker, showing the sequence of messages exchanged.
Another sequence diagram was also done up to illustrate the flow of the programme when the programme saves data to and reads data from
the text files.
